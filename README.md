# quittonebot
 Nostalgia-driven Telegram inline bot to mimic IRC-style quit messages. 

### WHAT THIS IS ABOUT

*Quittone*: just a playful Italian corruption of the word "quit".

To quote a long-time IRC user:

> Since Telegram took the act of quitting away, we can't even say goodbye properly.

This bot, therefore, is being developed to fulfill a long-standing need.

### INSTALL

This project is based on a [Google App Engine port](https://github.com/FollonSaxBass/python-telegram-bot-GAE) of a well-known [Telegram bot library](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot).

Clone or download this repository, and then follow the [instructions](https://github.com/kolmogorov42/python-telegram-bot-GAE) provided in my own fork of the GAE port.

### USAGE

If you just want to use it, first say goodbye to your friends properly, then type `@quittonebot` followed by your message in any Telegram chat window and click on the result.

Enjoy.
